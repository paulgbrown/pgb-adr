# 1. Use Architectural Decision Records

2021-01-06

## Status

Implemented

## Context

decisions may even be made after implementation. There needs to be a lightweight way to record the decision
for future reference. 

## Decision

Use lightweight Architectural Decision Records

## Consequences

None at this time.
