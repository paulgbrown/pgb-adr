# 2. Use single executable

2021-01-06

## Status

Implemented

## Context

Traditional console application deployments have numerous files making them cumbersome to deploy and hard to 
cleanup. A single EXE file makes it much easier to deploy and only the one file needs to be deleted for cleanup.

## Decision

Create one single EXE.

## Consequences

The EXE file may be large.
